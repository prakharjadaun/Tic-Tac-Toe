# **Tic Tac Toe using C**

In this project, I have implemented Tic Tac Toe game using C programming. When you compile the code, it first greets you with the rules of the game and then asks you to enter the name of the two players. Then you are good to go!

It covers the basic concepts of C programming such as arrays, looping, functions, problem solving and logic building.
